The goal of this test is to see if I can integrate flask with npm modules - specifically three.js.  This is mostly adapted from this website: https://codeburst.io/creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-python-npm-webpack-and-react-8925800503d9

In order to build this project, you will need both python and node.js installed.

After cloning the repository, start by installing the flaskpn python package in a virtual environment.
```console
>> mkdir .venv
>> cd .venv
>> python -m venv flasknpm
>> flasknpm\Scripts\activate
>> cd ..
>> python -m pip install -e .
```
